            <h1>Sandeep Kurmi</h1>
            <h3>And I'm a <span class="multiple-text"> </span></h3>
            <p>Hi, first of all, thanks for visiting this page. This page is all about me - Sandeep Kurmi
                You will get exciting things about my life. I was born in
                Budwar, Gaisabad Hatta, Damoh ,Mp, India. It is near to Dimond city Panna. Currently, I am
                living in Sagar , Mp . What to say about myself, I don't know. I am a simple guy
                from childhood, keen to learn new things and
                implement new ideas. Never worried about what I don't have. What I have is the best thing. I always
                think:
                "It's just a beginning". I have to achieve more. I want to see my growth endless. It's
                not my dream to touch the sky, I want to go beyond the sky. Finally, I would like to say, It's just the
                beginning. </p>

            <p>What to say about myself, I don't know. I am a simple guy from childhood, keen to learn new things and
                implement new ideas. Never worried about what I don't have. What I have is the best thing.! You can't
                get success without failures. After doing the 10th, I was not able to crack the Nda exam of
                a upsc. After doing the 11th, I failed in the entrance exam of JEE. It happened because I was weak in
                General Knowledge and mathemamtics at that time. But, I was the master of my subject. After completed
                12th ,I asked my parents go to indore for preparation Govt. exam , so my parents
                suggested in domoh but i am not interest in stuty in damoh so i meet in sagar collage sir , he talk me
                and understant in technical field so after listing i am interest in technical field after that i am
                invite to my home so he came my home and meet my parents so sir tell techinical field my parents so my
                parents also interest and i am decided i go in techinical field in cs branch and take admission b.tech
                in cs branch after that my interest increse in Computer . I have a strong belief in the existence of
                God. I think we are made of energy. One day, we will lose our
                energy (Aatma in Hindi), and it will go to the God again (Parmatma in Hindi).</p>
